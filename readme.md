# EDA – Forest Fires in Brazil 🔥🌳

## Project Overview
This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of forest fire incidents in Brazil.  
Brazil experiences frequent wildfires, particularly in the Amazon and Cerrado regions, which have severe environmental, economic, and social impacts.

The objective of this analysis is to explore historical wildfire data to uncover **patterns, trends, and possible contributing factors**, helping to support better **fire prevention and mitigation strategies**.

---

## Problem Statement
Forest fires in Brazil have increased over the years due to a combination of climatic conditions and human activities. Understanding:
- When fires occur most frequently
- Which regions are most affected
- How fire occurrences change over time  

is essential for data-driven environmental planning and policy-making.

---

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains historical forest fire records in Brazil, including:

- **State** – Brazilian state where the fire occurred  
- **Year** – Year of observation  
- **Month** – Month of occurrence  
- **Number of Fires** – Count of fire incidents  

_Source: Public environmental and satellite-based monitoring datasets_

## Objectives
- Analyze the **year-wise trend** of forest fires in Brazil  
- Identify **months and seasons** with the highest fire occurrences  
- Compare **state-wise fire distributions**  
- Detect patterns and anomalies in wildfire data  
- Support environmental awareness and risk assessment

---

## Tools & Technologies
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:**  
  - Pandas  
  - NumPy  
  - Matplotlib  
  - Seaborn  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

## Exploratory Data Analysis Steps
1. **Data Loading & Inspection**
   - Understand dataset structure
   - Check data types and missing values

2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handle missing or inconsistent records
   - Standardize month and year formats

3. **Univariate Analysis**
   - Distribution of fires by year
   - Monthly fire frequency

4. **Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis**
   - State-wise comparison of fire incidents
   - Seasonal trends across different regions

5. **Visualization**
   - Line charts for yearly trends
   - Bar plots for state and month-wise fires
   - Heatmaps for correlation analysis

---

## Key Insights
- Certain months show **consistently higher fire activity**, indicating seasonal influence  
- Some states are **significantly more affected** than others  
- Overall trends reveal **periods of sharp increase** in wildfire occurrences  

---

## Conclusion
The EDA highlights critical wildfire patterns in Brazil, emphasizing the importance of **seasonal monitoring and region-specific fire management strategies**. These insights can assist environmental agencies and policymakers in improving early-warning systems and preventive actions.

---

## Future Scope
- Include **climate variables** such as temperature and rainfall  
- Apply **time-series forecasting** to predict future fire incidents  
- Use **machine learning models** to identify high-risk regions
